# Framework coverage

What the analyzer models for each PHP framework/CMS, and — just as important — **what it does not yet
model** (so gaps are visible). Everything here is *data* in `php/ql/lib/ext/<framework>.model.yml`;
adapting a new framework is a data file, never an engine change. See
[adapting-frameworks.md](adapting-frameworks.md) for the how-to.

**Legend** — ✅ modeled · ⚠️ partial / high-FP-risk names only-if-distinctive · ❌ not modeled ·
🧪 modeled but not yet validated against a test corpus · n/a not applicable to that framework.

## Route → source support

An HTTP handler's user-controlled parameters become taint sources via the generic
`routeHandlerModel(subjectKind, name, handlerArgIndex)` mechanism, then the **interprocedural** engine
carries the taint through however many function/method calls the handler makes before reaching a sink
(the real-world case — the bug is usually several calls deep, not in the handler itself). A parameter is
a route source when it is untyped or **scalar-typed** (`int $id`, `string $slug`); parameters typed as a
class (a DI service or model-bound object) are excluded.

- ✅ **Closure handlers** — `Route::get('/u/{id}', fn($id) => …)`, `add_shortcode('t', fn($atts) => …)`.
- ✅ **Controller handlers** — `Route::get('/u/{id}', [UserController::class, 'show'])`,
  `Route::delete('/u/{id}', 'UserController@destroy')`: the resolved action method's scalar parameters
  become sources, tracked interprocedurally into the action's call graph.
- ✅ **Attribute/annotation routing** (Symfony `#[Route('/u/{id}')] public function show(int $id)`): the
  scalar action parameters become sources via the generic `routeAttributeModel` (data row: the attribute
  short-name, e.g. `Route`), tracked interprocedurally into the action.
- ✅ **`Route::resource('photos', PhotoController::class)` / `apiResource`** — the conventional RESTful
  actions that receive the `{resource}` id (`show`/`edit`/`update`/`destroy`) have their scalar id
  parameter resolved as a source (via `routeResourceModel`).
- **n/a — declarative routing** (Magento `routes.xml`, Joomla `task=`, TYPO3): there is no per-route
  callable; user input enters through the request object (`getParam`/`Input::get`) which *is* modeled
  as a source, so no route mechanism is needed.

## Templating

Two distinct template risks are modeled:

- **Output XSS** — tainted data reaching page output. Covered: `echo`, `print`, `<?= … ?>` short-echo
  tag (the workhorse of `.phtml` / WordPress & Magento themes / compiled Blade & Twig), `printf` /
  `vprintf` / `print_r`, WordPress `_e` / `_ex` / `wp_die`, and framework raw-HTML helpers that bypass
  auto-escaping (`Str::markdown` / `inlineMarkdown`) modeled as taint steps so they still reach the echo.
- **Server-side template injection (SSTI)** — a user-controlled *template string* reaching a compiler:
  Twig `createTemplate` / `render`, Blade `Blade::render` / `compileString`, Smarty `fetch` / `display`,
  Latte `renderToString`, Mustache `loadTemplate`, generic `compile` (see `ext/templating.model.yml`).

**Gap — template-engine source syntax.** Blade `{!! $x !!}` and Twig `{{ x|raw }}` are template-file
syntax, not PHP calls — the PHP extractor sees them as HTML text, so raw output written *in the template
file* is not tracked. This needs a Blade/Twig grammar or a precompile step. **Note:** if you analyze
*compiled* templates (Laravel `storage/framework/views`, Twig `var/cache`), they are plain PHP `echo`
and fully covered — pointing the scan at the compiled views is the practical workaround.

## Known gaps (what is NOT supported)

- **Template-engine source syntax** (Blade `{!! $x !!}`, Twig `{{ x|raw }}` written in `.blade.php` /
  `.twig` files): template-file syntax, not a PHP call — see the Templating section (compiled templates
  ARE covered). PHP-level output (`echo`/`print`/`<?=`/`printf`) is fully modeled.
- **Class-property sources** (WordPress `WP::$query_vars`, `WP_Query::$query_vars`): field access, not
  a call, so not expressible as a method row.
- 37/40 patterns in the ComplexFlows test suite flow — constructor-promoted fields, private
  setter/getter, DI-typed request properties (on `vendor/` classes), fluent collection/string pipelines,
  magic `__get`/`__set`, generators, `array_map`/`merge`/`column`, `parse_str` out-refs, interpolated
  method calls (incl. heredoc), by-reference `foreach` write-back, nullsafe `?->` chains, named args &
  named-key spread, multi-condition `match`, `??=`, `data_get`, string-transform builtins, and
  controller/attribute/resource route params — with interprocedural tracking across several call layers.
  The 3 remaining niche gaps are engine-complexity limits, not data fixes:
  - **First-class-callable to a builtin** (`$f = strtoupper(...); $f($x)`): the library step is not
    applied through the lambda dispatch (same shape as the `call_user_func('builtin', …)` case).
  - **Static local persistence** (`static $s; $s = $tainted;` read on a later call): static-variable
    state across invocations is not tracked.
  - **Exception message across throw/catch** (`throw new Exception($tainted)` → `$e->getMessage()`):
    exceptional control flow + the internal message field are not modelled.
- **Context/flow-dependent audit rules**: `openssl-decrypt-validate` (needs HMAC-validation context),
  `base-convert-loses-precision`, `md5-used-as-password` (needs value flow) — the same call is safe or
  unsafe depending on surrounding code, so no precise syntactic rule exists.
- **Nested-array handlers** (WordPress `register_rest_route($ns, $r, ['callback' => …])`): the handler
  is inside an array argument, not a positional one; the current route mechanism resolves positional
  closures only.
- **Magento/Joomla** models (🧪) are researched from the official docs but not yet validated against a
  test corpus — recall on real Magento/Joomla code is unmeasured (they carry the same FP guarantees as
  the corpus-validated frameworks: no new false positives on the benchmark's 176 negative cases).

## Precision guarantees

Every row is chosen to keep the benchmark's false-positive count unchanged (currently 40/176 negatives).
Generic method names (`get`/`query`/`request`/`read`/`quote`) are **class-scoped** via `typedSourceModel`
/ `typedSinkModel` / `typedSanitizerModel` so they only fire on the right framework class. Kind-specific
sanitizers that would mask other vuln classes (e.g. an XSS-only escaper clearing SQLi) are deliberately
omitted.

**Typed models resolve against the written type name, not just declared classes.** A receiver's class is
matched by type *inference* (declared/instantiated classes) OR by the type *annotation* it carries
(`function store(Request $request)`, `private Request $req`) — so the class-scoped models fire even when
the framework class lives in an un-extracted `vendor/` (the normal case for real projects). Without this,
every typed source/sink/sanitizer would silently miss on real framework code.
